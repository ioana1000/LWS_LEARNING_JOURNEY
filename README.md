# Learning Journey

This application is an example of how an implementation with Swelte, JavaScript is possible. The roadmap templates are created with the mockup tool __Balsamiq__, exported as a JSON file and converted to an SVG file using an NPM library named 'roadmap-renderer'. The SVG file is integrated into the HTML DOM and certain elements are provided with a click event handler. Using CSS, certain SVG elements are color-coded when hovering.
